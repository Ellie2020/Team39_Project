# Team39_Project
My contribution to Team39 project for DA Udacity Competition
TEAM39_ladybirds (MYSELF, ANA SUSTIC AND RUDO TAKAVARASHA) has worked toward the visulaization of "WHO IS TAKING ONLINE COURSES?"
by studying the combination of AGE vs HOURS LEARNING per week vs GENDER. The data are from an opensouce survey from FreeCodeCamp (FCC)

Bot myself and Ana Sustic used Pyton. We decided to work independetly in order to see whether we could find similar results or not.
This repo is about the work I have done in the Ladybirds (subgroup of team39 (a.k.a Keep_calm_Team39)).
